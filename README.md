## üìà Key Findings & Insights

* **Tier 1 Locations Identified**: **Koramangala** and **Indiranagar** were identified as top-tier locations, having both a high volume of restaurants and the highest average customer ratings.
* **Quality Over Price**: The analysis revealed only a **weak positive correlation between cost and rating**. This indicates that customers value quality and experience over price, presenting an opportunity for high-quality, affordable restaurants to thrive.
* **Market is Competitive**: The distribution of ratings is skewed towards the high end (avg. ~3.8), showing that the Bangalore market has high standards and a low tolerance for poor quality.
* **Healthy Food is a Niche**: While the market is dominated by North Indian and Chinese cuisines, "Healthy Food" exists as a smaller, less saturated niche, indicating a potential market opportunity.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Data Limitations

It is important to note that this dataset is approximately **7 years old** (circa 2018). While specific restaurant listings and prices will be outdated, this analysis treats the data as a **historical benchmark** to understand the fundamental, long-term structure of Bangalore's food market. Core patterns such as neighborhood characteristics, dominant cuisines, and general customer price sensitivity are likely to remain relevant.
